User Story / Gameplay:

1. Describe the gameplay

2. What are the conditions when the game begins?

3. Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?

4. What ifs will there be?

Visual Game Components:

What are the visual game components? For example, in Bouncing Box, the game components were the board and the box.
Which will be static? (the board)
Which will be animated? (the box)
What data will you need to manage each game component? For example, in Bouncing Box, the data values were positionX, speedX, and points.

Events / Logic:
What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)
How do those events affect the data of the program?
For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!
